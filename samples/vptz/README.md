*vptz* sample
--------------
This sample demonstrates how to use the Virtual PTZ module to evaluate a tracking algorithm. No actual algorithm implementation is used here, so a static bounding box is used instead. This is the baseline code you should study if you wish to evaluate your own method. See the [source code](./src/main.cpp) comments for more details.
