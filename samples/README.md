LITIV Samples
-------------
The executable projects in this directory present how to use the LITIV API & modules in a high-level fashion; each should be properly described by comments in the source code. This is a good entry point to get familiar with the framework, or if you only wish to have a minimalist example of how to get an algorithm working.

The samples presented here may rely only on data available in the repository's *samples/data* directory, or on data provided by the user. This ensures all of them can run out-of-the-box without downloading any dataset.

More should be added over time.
