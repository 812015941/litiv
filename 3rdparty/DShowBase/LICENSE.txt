This project is inspired by Leapmotion's similar initiative; see:

The GMFBridge utility was introduced by Geraint Davies; for more information, see:
http://www.gdcl.co.uk/gmfbridge/

The DirectShow base classes are required to build, deploy and register DirectShow
filters for multimedia capture and preview on Windows platforms. These were packaged
as part of the Windows SDK samples for years, but lately, it is getting harder and
harder to find them online (especially since the Windows 10 launch). These are
provided here under Microsoft's original SDK licensing terms.
