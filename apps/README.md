LITIV Applications
------------------
The executable projects in this directory use the LITIV API & modules to solve and evaluate various computer vision algorithms. The code here is very dense and mostly uncommented (except maybe for the VPTZ apps), as it mostly consists of benchmarks and sandboxes. For an easier introduction to the framework, see the samples folder one level up.

Note that most executables here also expect that the DATASET_ROOT CMake variable is properly configured, and points to a directory where various datasets are present.
